## removed objects
- data objects `c14bazAAR::country_thesaurus`, `c14bazAAR::material_thesaurus`, `c14bazAAR::variable-reference` have been removed from the package -- they are queried from [here](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR/tree/master/data-raw) anyway and it's not necessary to put them into the package
- some helper functions have been made internal
- .Rd files for unexported, internal objects have been removed (@noRd)
